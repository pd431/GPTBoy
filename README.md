# GPTBoy

This project aims to use artificial intelligence (AI) to assist in the development of an emulator for the Gameboy console. The AI model ChatGPT will be used to write the emulator in the programming language Rust.

Our goal is to explore the potential for AI to assist in software development tasks, and to evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of the resulting code. By using AI to write the emulator, we hope to gain a better understanding of the capabilities and limitations of machine learning algorithms in this context.

## Evaluation

In evaluating the success of this project, we will consider the following metrics:

- The speed and accuracy of the emulator in running Gameboy games
- The readability and maintainability of the AI-generated code
- The amount of human oversight and input required in the development process
- The process of training and fine-tuning the AI model

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this project, please note that all code submissions must be generated by the AI model ChatGPT. To contribute, fork the repository and submit a pull request with your AI-generated code. We welcome any and all contributions, from bug fixes to new features.
